// Package loader implements ResourceLoader — the entry point that
// scans a local filesystem path, decodes every YAML document found,
// and adds the recognized Flux objects to a Store.
//
// Loader honors a `.krmignore`-style ignore file at the scan root.
// Unrecognized objects (Pods, Deployments, etc.) are silently skipped
// to match flux-local's pre-filtering: fluxrr derives them later from
// the rendered output of Kustomizations and HelmReleases.
